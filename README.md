## ✨ Overview
**SecureOne** is a **Telegram-based password vault bot** built with Python.  
It provides users with a secure way to **store, manage, and retrieve credentials** directly inside Telegram using **end-to-end encryption (Fernet)**.  

Instead of relying on insecure notes or remembering dozens of credentials, you can securely manage them through a friendly bot interface.  

---

## 🎯 Motivation
Managing passwords has become a daily struggle. Many people reuse weak passwords or store them in unsafe ways (like text files or notes apps).  

I built **SecureOne** because:  
- I wanted a **lightweight, free alternative** to commercial password managers.  
- I wanted to learn about **bot development, data encryption, and security practices**.  
- I wanted to make password management **simple, portable, and accessible** for everyone.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔑 **Encrypted Storage** → All credentials stored with **Fernet AES-128 encryption**.  
- 👤 **User Authentication** → Registration system before access.  
- 📂 **CRUD Operations** → Add, update, delete, and view credentials easily.  
- 🎲 **Password Generator** → Generate strong, random passwords instantly.  
- 💾 **Lightweight Storage** → Uses JSON files for simplicity.  
- 🤖 **Telegram Bot Interface** → Manage everything directly in Telegram chat.  
- 🧼 **Clean & Modular Codebase** → Easy to extend with new features.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- Python **3.10+**
- A **Telegram Bot Token** from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

### 📥 Steps
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SecureOne-Bot.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd SecureOne-Bot

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the bot
python main.py

🎮 Usage

Start your bot in Telegram (/start).

Register with your unique user ID.

Use commands:

/add → Save a new credential

/get → Retrieve stored credentials

/update → Update existing entry

/delete → Remove credentials

/generate → Generate a strong random password

🔒 Security

Uses Fernet symmetric encryption (AES under the hood).

No credentials stored in plain text.

Each user has a unique encrypted storage area.

Secrets (bot token, keys) should be kept in environment variables or a .env file (not hardcoded).

⚠️ Note: Since this uses JSON file storage, it’s ideal for personal/small-scale use, not enterprise deployment.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes and personal use.
While SecureOne uses industry-standard encryption, I do not take responsibility for any data loss, breaches, or misuse.
For enterprise-grade password management, use a professional solution like Bitwarden or 1Password.

✨ This version covers **everything**: why it exists, how it works, features, structure, install, usage, security, disclaimer, and license.  

👉 Do you want me to also add a **"Future Improvements" / "Roadmap" section** (like database migration, multi-user support, Docker deployment, etc.) so it looks even more like a professional open-source project?
